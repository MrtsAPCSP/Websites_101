# 🌐 Introduction to Making Websites

Welcome! This guide will help you take your **first steps** into building websites using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It's not about rules — it's about giving you tools so you can **create whatever you imagine**.

## 🧱 What You'll Be Using

| Language     | What It Does                             |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **HTML**     | Builds the structure of your site (headings, paragraphs, buttons, etc.) |
| **CSS**      | Styles your site (colors, fonts, layout)  |
| **JavaScript** | Makes your site interactive (clicks, animations, logic) |

## 🚀 Getting Started

You only need a **browser** (like Chrome) and a **code editor** (we recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)).

1. Create a new folder for your website.
2. Inside it, create three files:
    - `index.html`
    - `styles.css`
    - `script.js`
3. Open `index.html` and add this starter code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My First Website</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>

  <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  <p>This is my first website.</p>
  <button onclick="sayHi()">Click Me</button>

  <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
````

4. Then in `styles.css`, try something like:

```css
body {
  background-color: lightblue;
  font-family: sans-serif;
}
```

5. And in `script.js`, try:

```js
function sayHi() {
  alert("Hi there!");
}
```
